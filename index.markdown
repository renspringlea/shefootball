# Salary

Note that this data is from 2017 and might be a little bit out of date — naturally, high-quality data on people's salaries is sensitive and hard to obtain. On the other hand, a 2024 survey by FIFA reported that a mean salary of 24,030 USD for women players in "Tier 1" leagues, which is comparable to the values used in this graph. That same FIFA survey found that salaries for players in lower-tier leagues drop off very quickly to 4,361 USD (Tier 2) and 2,805 (Tier 3) — in US dollars per year!

# Attendance

There has been a steady increase in the number of fans attending top-flight women's club football matches in England, the United States, and Germany. Australia is lagging, while Japan has a long history of high attendance compared to other countries. All countries took a temporary hit around 2020 due to the pandemic.

# ACL injuries

Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are a type of serious knee injury that affect women footballers around 2.5 times as frequently as men ([Bloch et al 2025](https://esskajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ksa.70160)). Long recovery times means that players are often out for a year or longer ([Abed et al 2023](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/23259671231164944)), and Sam Kerr's ACL injury kept her out of the game for 20 months ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Kerr)).

The causes of the higher rate of ACL injuries in women are currently the topic of active debate, and it is likely that our understanding will evolve over the next few years as major sporting bodies conduct studies ([BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/cxwv38dp748o)). Some key academic sources on this topic are summarized in my blog article [here](https://ryba.ren/2025/01/16/acl-injuries.html).

# Barriers

In several countries, there are major legal barriers preventing women from participating in football. Afghanistan has banned women from playing sport since the Taliban takeover in 2021, and football players were targeted for violence — many of Afghanistan's international players were evacuated and settled in Australia ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan_women%27s_national_football_team#2021_Taliban_takeover_and_disbandment)). Likewise, women's football is banned in Brunei.

Recent news that Qatar was in talks with FIFA to host the first Women's Club World Cup ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2026/jan/12/qatar-talks-fifa-host-first-womens-club-world-cup-january-2028)) were widely criticized because Qatar is not exactly a paragon of women's football, women's rights, or LGBT+ rights. Qatar's national women's football team has been inactive for over a decade, and being gay is punishable by death ([Independent])(https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/gay-lesbian-bisexual-relationships-illegal-in-74-countries-a7033666.html).

It is also worth noting that many European countries banned women from playing football during the 20th century. Notably, the FA's 1921 ban on women playing football in England was only lifted in 1971 ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bans_of_women%27s_association_football)).
